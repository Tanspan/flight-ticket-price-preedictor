### Flight Price Prediction

### Overview

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various parameters such as airline, source, destination, departure time, arrival time, duration, total stops, and more. The model is built using machine learning techniques in Python.

### Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Machine learning model selection and training
Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
Model evaluation and performance metrics

### Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
Scikit-learn
Machine Learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

### Dataset

The dataset consists of flight booking records with details such as airline, source, destination, number of stops, departure time, arrival time, duration, and price.

### Usage

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Train different machine learning models.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².
Use the trained model to predict flight prices for new data.

### Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
Predictions can be visualized using plots.
Feature importance analysis is conducted to understand key factors influencing prices.
